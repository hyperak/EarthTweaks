# EarthTweaks

Cuberite plugin to enhance the experience with the http://earth.motfe.net map. No, the project won't die before it's finished. I *guarantee* it.

Feel free to suggest ideas and report bugs in the issues page.

## Features and roadmap
In no particular order:

- [ ] Climate phenomenons
  	- [x] Catatumbo lightning
- [ ] Coordinate finder
  	- [ ] Get in-game coordinates from DD (decimal degree) coordinates
	    * [x] Backend
	    * [ ] In-game commands
	- [ ] Convert in-game coordinates to DD coordinates
- [ ] Real weather
	- [ ] OpenWeatherMap API usage
	- [ ] Compute real coordinates as the player's location changes (depends on in-game coords -> DD coords)
	- [ ] Post Cuberite issue for regioned weather (not the entire world) in the API
